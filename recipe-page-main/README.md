## Overview

In this project, I tackled the Recipe page challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge required creating a responsive webpage that displays a recipe with ingredients and instructions. I approached the project by initially designing for desktop screens and then implementing responsive adjustments for smaller screens. This allowed me to prioritize the desktop layout while ensuring a smooth transition to mobile and tablet devices. I focused on utilizing semantic HTML5 markup and clean CSS code to achieve a visually appealing and functional recipe page
