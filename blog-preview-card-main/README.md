Additionally, I plan to explore advanced CSS techniques such as animations and transitions to enhance the visual appeal of my projects. I also intend to introduce JavaScript functionality to add interactivity and dynamic content. Furthermore, I aim to deepen my understanding of accessibility principles and techniques, ensuring that my projects are inclusive and accessible to all users.
