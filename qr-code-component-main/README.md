- Desktop-first workflow

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to further refine the responsiveness of my designs by testing on a wider range of devices and optimizing layouts for specific screen sizes. Additionally, I plan to explore advanced CSS techniques such as animations and transitions to enhance the visual appeal of my projects. I also intend to introduce JavaScript functionality to add interactivity and dynamic content. Furthermore, I aim to deepen my understanding of accessibility principles and techniques, ensuring that my projects are inclusive and accessible to all users. Finally, I plan to explore the integration of build tools and frameworks to streamline my development workflow and enhance project scalability.
