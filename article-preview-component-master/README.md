### Continued development

The Article Preview Component Solution offers a strong foundation, but there's room for further exploration:

- Data Integration: Explore integrating the component with a backend system or API to dynamically populate article data, making it easier to manage and display large amounts of content.
- Customization Options: Implement options to customize the component's appearance (e.g., font styles, color schemes, image sizes) to better match different website designs. This could be achieved with CSS variables or preprocessor features.
